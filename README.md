# File Organizer Utility (Toy Maven Project)

This is a toy Maven Java project that demonstrates a file-organizer utility.
The repository includes ~100 files (Java classes and supporting files) for
exploration and learning.

## How this archive was made

- A `steps` bash script is included at the project root which contains the
  git commands that would recreate commits file-by-file. You can run it
  in an empty directory to replay the commits.

## Build

```bash
mvn -q -DskipTests package
```
